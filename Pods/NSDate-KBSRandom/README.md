# NSDate+KBSRandom

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Keithbsmiley/NSDate-KBSRandom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Keithbsmiley/NSDate-KBSRandom)

As you can probably guess this is a simple category for creating random
NSDates. I'm planning on using this for testing as opposed to `[NSDate
date]`

```
pod 'NSDate-KBSRandom'
```
